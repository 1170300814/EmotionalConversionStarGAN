# EmotionalConversionStarGAN
This repository contains code to replicate results from the ICASSP 2020 paper "StarGAN for Emotional Speech Conversion: Validated by Data Augmentation of End-to-End Emotion Recognition".


- stargan: code for training the Emotional StarGAN and performing emotional generation (originally here - https://github.com/max-elliott/StarGAN-Emotional-VC).

- aug_evaluation: code for performing the data augmentation experiments (coming soon)

- samples: some samples selectively (coming soon - checking with IEMOCAP if we can publicly share according to GDPR)

The IEMOCAP database requires the signing of an EULA; please communicate with the handlers: https://sail.usc.edu/iemocap/
